		<h3>Mechatronical Student!</h3>
		<p>Hallo Jonathan Wandji is my name.I'm 23 Years old and i'm currently studying
			Mechatronics at the university of applied  Science Kaiserslautern. I've got few job Experiences beside of 
			my Studies for example as Working Student by CMF-Consulting where i had to make calls in English, french and 
			German to identificate people for opening their bank Account and i was able to apply and develop my Management
			and MS-Office Software Skills. I'm a huge fan of new Technologies, automation, CAD and never let an opportunity 
			to extend my knowdledges . There is much more to know about me but i would not be able to write it just in few Lines. Jonathan ☺️.

			<h3>Automation</h3>
			<p>I've always been fascinated by the fact that it's possible today to think, for example, about how you would like a particular machine to work and just type a few lines into a particular piece of software with the appropriate language and see the final product successfully implemented in reality.
				. The last project I did was with TIA-Portal and TwinCat to control a clock line. I can also handle Simulink, Matlab with a little bit of atmel-Studio7 and continue to expand my knowledge in this field.

			<h3> Computer Aided Design</h3>
			<p>
				Since I was a child, I started drawing with a pencil and a sheet of paper. This is how I was able to develop my efficiency and speed in drawing, which allows me today to use Creoparametric with an unparalleled ease. Since I am in this field, I am always learning new languages like SolidWorks for example, probably because I would like to make it my future job ☺️. 
				I really like the fact that I can express my imagination through my drawings made in CAD.

			<h3>Sharing my Knowledges</h3>
			<p>For many years, I have always understood the importance of managing people, not only in my  job purposes, but also in my own projects. That's why, for example, in addition to my studies and odd jobs, I am currently tutoring my little school friends to help them pass their exams. It is very important for me to help people to get the best out of themselves
				and to share my little knowledge with others because I am one of those who think that it is the best way to expand one's knowledge.

				<h4>Workpieces Station</h4>
				<p>In a Group of 2 Persons we haved programmed a lived cycle with TwinCAT and TIA-Portal for Workpieces.
					The Automation Consists of a "Fischertechnik" Cycle line with 2 processing Stations(One for milling and the
					other for drilling), 4 Converging belts arranged in U-Shape, 2 slides each with 2 limit switches and 5 light barriers
					for dectecting the Workpiece's position.

				<h4>Breaking System</h4>
				<p>Here we had to implement a driving Sytem which will be able to replace the breaks in a car and then automate the breaking process
					while driving. For this project we used Simulink and Matlab to realise it and visualized and analized the Results. It was a really big Experience, especially while 
					driving and testing our own breaking System.

				<h4>Fall of a Coin </h4>
				<p>
					In a Group of two Persons we were in charge of simulating the fall of a coin caused by the hammer blow several times. We used a stopwatch each time to note the time it takes
					for the coin to reach the ground in order to determine the average time and with that the average height of the table. It was very interesting for me to use my mathematical, physical And
					logical skills to simulate and visualize the results.
